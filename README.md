Scilab program for Scattering Phase Shifts for Neutron-Proton Scattering Using Phase Fnction Method with Malfliet-Tjon Potential

How to Run Program.                                                                                                                                         
This is the readme file for execution of Scattering Phase Shift Programs                                                        
Please follow these steps :                                                                                                                                
Step-1. Copy or write this code directly into Scinotes windows.                                                                       
Step-2. Save it with extension .sci                                                                                                                    
Step-3. Now execute this code window using function key 'F5' this automatically save and execute the program.                                                                                                                                            

OR
1. Download Repository 
2. Unzip it 
3. Open .sci file with Scilab 					
4. Press Function key "F5" this automatically save and execute the program
5. In Console Window type "Phaseplot()" without quotes
6. A figure window with required plots is visible.
